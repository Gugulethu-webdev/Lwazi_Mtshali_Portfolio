          <p>
            My innate love for programming and solving complex problems with code, makes me a valuable addition to any team. I taught myself a great deal about web development through FreecodeCamp, W3school and other learning platforms. My curiosity is what fuels me to push on and on. My understanding of various web development technologies makes me versatile and easy to work with. I am willing to learn from others and on my own which is an imperative attitude one should have as a developer in order to be able to progress and deliver great results.
